Hello everyone, I'm 高健鸿. Today I would introduce one of my favorite dishes, Lychee meat, which is called 荔枝肉 in Chinese ,and the process of how to do the cuisine. When I was in SHANGHAI for my bachelor's degree, it's my favorite cuisine which could cure my homesickness. 

As we know, Lychee meat is widely known in Fuzhou as traditional cuisine with long history. The name of Lychee meat is stemmed from Lychee ,one of subtropical fruits,because the outlook and the taste of the cuisine is similar to Lychee partly. 

Before cooking,you need to prepare the main ingredients such pork fillet,potatoes,tomato sauce and other accessories.Chop scallion,  ginger and garlic very fine, put on side

Firstly,cut the pork fillet into slices in middle scale,and marinade them with a pinch of salt, 
pepper powder, and egg whites about half an hour. Then, mix the pork with a little dry starch and shaped into balls ,deep fry the balls and potato which has been cut into slices until golden.
 
Secondly, Chop scallion,  ginger and garlic very fine, put on side;add little suger, salt,boiled water with potato sauce and beat until combined to make the sauce.you can adjust the taste of the sauce by yourself.

Finally, heat the wok, pour a little oil,stir fry the scallion,  ginger and garlic until you smell delicious flavor.Then put the meat balls and the pieces of potato prepared into the wok,pour the sauce we made, and add starch and water to make the sauce more thick.Simmer the mixture about few minutes,and you can put the dish on the plate and enjoy it.
